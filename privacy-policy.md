# Privacy Policy for Scroll Miles

Scroll Miles is a Chrome extension designed to measure how far users scroll across websites and visualize it with weekly charts and fun achievement badges.

## What We Collect

- We **do not** collect or transmit any personally identifiable information.
- The only activity measured is **scroll distance**, tracked locally in your browser.
- No data is sent to any server or third-party service.

## Storage

All scroll data is stored using Chrome's `storage.local` API and remains within your browser. You have full control and can clear it at any time.

## Permissions

The extension requests minimal permissions:
- `storage`: to save scroll distance and badges locally
- `scripting` & `activeTab`: to inject tracking code into active pages
- `<all_urls>`: to function on all sites (but **no content is read or saved**)

## Contact

This extension was built for fun and personal insight.
